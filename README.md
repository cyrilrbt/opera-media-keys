# Opera (extension for) Media Keys

Use your media keys to play/pause, skip, and go to previous song.

Issues due to this being built in about 30 minutes:

- If you have multiple tabs opened on YouTube it will play/pause all of them.
- Only works with YouTube
- Video pop-out will close on next/prev actions. I'm probably not doing it the right way, I didn't feel like spending a ton of time trying to figure out how YouTube's js works
